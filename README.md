# Dyson Outsize Dust Bin Latch

This is the L-shaped latch that holds the front of the dust collection bin on a Dyson Outsize cordless stick vacuum cleaner.  It is released when the bin is emptied via a push rod that applies pressure against the spring this part contains.  Our vacuum was dropped, breaking the latch end and preventing the dust bin cover from latching.  The part was not available separate from the bin assembly, so this is an initial attempt at creating a replacement part that can be 3D printed.
